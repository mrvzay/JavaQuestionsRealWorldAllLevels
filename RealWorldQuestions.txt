REQUEST METHODS FOR REST API :

GET - Retrieve details of a resource ?
POST - Create a new resource ?
PUT - Update an existing resource ?

 	- 201 => Created
 	- 204 => No Content
 	- 401 => Unauthorized(When authorization fails)
 	- 400 => Bad Request(Such as validation error)
 	- 404 => Resource Not Found
